# Round-Robin-Scheduling
This is a repo for one of my university modules where we were tasked to simulate how scheduling algorithms work (Round Robin algorithm in our case), everything has been done with java but we also decided to add an additional website for the whole processes not just a GUI file. 

# How to run the files locally:
This repo will contain (7) .java files that make up the application, listed as follows:
1. AppFrame.java (contains main)
2. GanttChartPanel.java
3. InputFormPanel.java
4. OutputPanel.java
5. RoundRobinScheduler.java
6. SimulationResult.java
7. WelcomePanel.java

Copy & Paste or Drag & Drop the files to an IDE of choice, or a text editor like VS Code, with all files in the same directory.

Once you have all (7) files in the same directory in an IDE or text editor, simply run AppFrame.java

If you have Java installed, and have all the files in a folder, you can use command line to compile and run the program using the following commands:
1. cd path/to/the/folder/with/the/java/files
2. javac *.java
3. java AppFrame

AppFrame.java contains the main method, therefore running it will execute the entire application.
